synthetization process in the ribosome.\n","\n",">> Rather, it is a dynamical process which strongly depends on intrinsic properties such as the amino acid sequence, but it is also influenced by the solution properties and temperature of the surrounding solvent.\n","\n","### Typical folding times are of the order of milliseconds to seconds. \n","\n","\n","---\n","\n","One of the most substantial problems in the understanding of protein folding is the “strategy” the protein follows in finding the unique conformation (geometrical structure), the so-called native fold. \n","\n","---\n","\n","\n","## Thermodynamically, this native conformation represents the state of minimal free energy. \n","\n","### *Therefore, protein folding is not simply an energetic minimization process – it is also affected by entropic forces.\n","\n","> This means that the folding trajectory is a stochastic process from a mostly random initial structure towards the global free-energy minimum, thereby circumventing free-energy barriers.\n","\n",">>The free-energy landscape of a protein, considered as a function of the protein’s degrees of freedom, is commonly assumed to be extremely rugged and complex and it seems paradox that the protein is able to find the ”needle-in-a-haystack” structure by a stochastic search process within a relatively short time period.\n","\n","### Protein folding is, however, also a process of high cooperativity, i.e., structure formation requires a collective arrangement of at least a subset of the degrees of freedom.\n","\n","## For this reason, it is expected that a single or a few cooperativity parameter(s) – comparable to order parameters in thermodynamic phase transitions – allow(s) for the discrimination between dominating macrostates, i.e., the structural “phases”. \n","\n","A strongly simplified sketch of such a free-energy landscape as a function of a single cooperativity parameter is shown in Fig. 1.5.\n","\n","<!DOCTYPE html>\n","<html>\n","\n","<head>\n","    <meta charset=\"utf-8\" />\n","    <meta http-equiv=\"X-UA-Compatible\" content=\"IE=edge\">\n","

\n","\n",">Local folding processes can cause weakly stable or metastable conformations that slow down the folding process. \n","\n",">>Thus, the folding channel is not necessarily smooth and local free-energy minima can be present in the funnel.\n","\n","\n","The assumption of the existence of a reduced set of relevant collective degrees of freedom thus enables a generalized view of folding processes as structural or conformational transitions and their classification.\n","\n","Indeed, there has been an enormous progress in this direction within the past years, and candidates with comparatively simple folding trajectories were identified. \n","\n",">> This regards, e.g., single-exponential or downhill folding, where no barriers hinder and slow down the folding process.\n","\n",">> Another prominent example is two-state folding, a “first-order-like”, “discontinuous” transition with a single barrier.\n","\n",">> More complex are “folding-through-intermediates” events with more than one free-energy barrier or even metastability, where the native fold is degenerate and, therefore, the formation of different structures is (almost) likely probable. \n","\n","The latter case is obviously important for proteins involved in mechanical or motoric processes, where local refolding can be necessary for fulfilling a specific biological function."]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"id":"4HNdQ5sFxQU6","colab_type":"code","colab":{}},"source":[""],"execution_count":0,"outputs":[]}]}
