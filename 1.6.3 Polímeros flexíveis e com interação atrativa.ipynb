imposes a stiffness large enough that a segment of the chain does not interact with any other part of the same chain on large length scales dominated by the persistence length. \n","\n","### In addition, DNA nucleotides are negatively charged, such that non-bonded units repel each other by Coulomb interaction.\n","\n","### However, there are also polymers consisting of units that enable effective molecular attraction between non-bonded parts of the chain.\n","\n","### We have already discussed the proteins as a class of polymers, in which non-bonded interaction between different monomers significantly contributes to the folding properties. \n","\n","### Generally, structural changes that lead to qualitatively different conformations, so-called conformational transitions, require an effective attractive interaction between non-bonded monomers. \n","\n","### These effective attractive forces typically compete with repulsive, short-range volume exclusion effects. \n","\n","### Therefore, in contrast to rather stiff polymers such as DNA, only flexible polymers can undergo such major structural changes on comparatively short length scales.\n","\n","### The most unspecific among the non-bonded interactions is caused by van der Waals forces, which correspond to effective, electric dipole–dipole interactions between atomic or molecular units. \n","\n","### In the absence of stronger interactions, such as the Coulomb interaction between charged units, van der Waals forces are most essential for structure formation processes. \n","\n","## In fact, for neutral, flexible polymers with no hydrogen-bond supporting units (an example is polyethylene $-[C_2H_4]_n-)$, van der Waals forces are the only driving forces toward compact structures.\n","\n","### Because of its importance we will discuss the electrostatic origin of these forces in more detail in the following. \n","\n","### We start off by writing down the Coulomb potential between two charge distributions $\\rho_1(\\vec{r}_1)$ and $\\rho_2(\\vec{r}_2)$, which are considered to be neutral, i.e., the net charge is zero:\n","\n","\\begin{equation}\n","Q_{1,2}=\\int d^3
