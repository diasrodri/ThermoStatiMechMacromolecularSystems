They are too large for a quantum-chemical treatment, but too small and too specific for a classical, macroscopic description. They do not at all fulfill the prerequisites of the thermodynamic limit and, thus, do not scale. In\n","consequence, the standard statistical theory of phase transitions is not directly applicable, although many aspects of molecular structure formation processes resemble those known from phase transitions. Since twenty types of amino acids occur in bioproteins, the num-\n","ber of possible compositions is astronomically large, but only of the order of 100 000 highly specific types of bioproteins are functional in the human cell system. Beside this obviously elementary evolutionary aspect, the heterogeneous composition (which causes glasslike behavior) and their high specialization level raises the question, to what extent folding properties can be generic at all. This is actually one of the key questions. A negative answer is not very likely; nature has always proven that even most complex structures possess symmetries (in a more general context), which explain their stability. Stability is necessary, because these molecular systems exist and function in a thermal environment. It is even appropriate to formulate the whole problem in the following way: It is the interplay and balance between system and environment that stabilizes the structure of the system. Having said that, there is no reasonable way to try to understand any structure formation process without including thermodynamics and, therefore, statistical mechanics."]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"IqOkrhIzexmC","colab_type":"text"},"source":["In the first chapter of this book, we begin with an introduction of the molecular structure and the modeling of biomolecules, exemplified for proteins. Fundamental aspects of thermodynamics and statistical mechanics, with emphasis on finite-size effects and their statistical analysis, are reviewed in Chapter 2. In Chapter 3, properties of the complete sequence and conformation space are systematically analyzed for short lattice proteins by exact enumeration of a minimalistic hydrophobic-polar heteropolymer model. Computer simulations of larger systems require efficient algorithms. Such algorithms are reviewed in Chapter 4 and important aspects of analyses of finitely long time series of data generated by these algorithms are discussed. As a first application, the study of homopolymer freezing and collapse transitions on regular lattices is the subject of Chapter 5. In this regard, the influence of surface and finite-size effects upon crystallization of elastic flexible and semiflexible polymers is addressed in detail in Chapters 6 and 7, respectively. Returning to proteins, characteristic folding properties of proteins and the classification of folding channels are investigated in Chapters 8 and 9. Generic local geometries like secondary structures induced by constraints that effectively reflect many-body effects are discussed in Chapter 10 by introducing tube-like polymers. The extension of coarse-grained modeling to multiple-chain systems is described in Chapter 11, where also analyses of aggregation transitions of short heteropolymers in different statistical ensembles are presented. In Chapter 12, we unravel the hierarchical nature of phase transitions by discussing the exemplified aggregation transition of homopolymers. Pseudophase diagrams of adsorption processes of lattice and off-lattice homopolymers to solid substrates are discussed in detail in Chapter 13. An introductory, simple example for substrate-specific binding of peptides to solid substrates is investigated in detail in Chapter 14."]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"id":"sBQ9xTd_ddcq","colab_type":"code","colab":{}},"source":[""],"execution_count":0,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"id":"tW3gz-Jeewsx","colab_type":"code","colab":{}},"source":[""],"execution_count":0,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"HQ9I_Pm7djiM","colab_type":"text"},"source":[""]}]}
